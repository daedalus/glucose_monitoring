### Overview ###

This tool generates a comprehensive Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) with extended clinical metrics, including Time in Tight Range (TITR) metric. It processes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and produces both a visual AGP plot and detailed statistical analysis.

### Features ###

#### General  ####

- Full AGP visualization with percentile curves (5-95%, IQR)
- Rate of Change (ROC) profile
- Circadian binning for time-of-day patterns

#### Time in Range metrics with level breakdowns: ####

- TIR (70-180 mg/dL)
- TITR (70-140 mg/dL) - Tight target
- TAR with Level 1 (181-250) and Level 2 (>250)
- TBR with Level 1 (54-69) and Level 2 (<54)

#### Advanced variability metrics: ####

- MAGE (Mean Amplitude of Glycemic Excursions)
- MODD (Mean of Daily Differences)
- CONGA (Continuous Overall Net Glycemic Action)

#### Risk indices: ####

- LBGI (Low Blood Glucose Index)
- HBGI (High Blood Glucose Index)
- ADRR (Average Daily Risk Range)

### AUC analysis: ####

- total, above range, below range

### Data quality assessment: ####

- wear time, reading frequency

### Requirements ###

#### Packages ####

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Input Data Format ####

- Excel file with two columns:
- Time: datetime (e.g., "2024-01-01 08:00:00")
- Sensor Reading(mg/dL): numeric glucose values

### Usage ###

bash

`python get_sensor.py your_glucose_data.xlsx`

### Metrics Explained ###

#### Core Metrics ####

Metric	Description	Clinical Target

- TIR	Time in Range (70-180 mg/dL)	≥70%
- TITR	Time in Tight Range (70-140 mg/dL)	≥50%
- TBR	Time Below Range (<70 mg/dL)	<4%
- CV	Coefficient of Variation	<36%
- GMI	Glucose Management Indicator	below 7%
- J-Index	Combined mean + variability	n/a

#### Variability Metrics ####

Metric	Description

- MAGE	Mean amplitude of glycemic excursions
- MODD	Day-to-day glucose variability
- CONGA	Intra-day glycemic variability (1h lag)

### Risk Metrics ####

Metric	Description

- LBGI	Low Blood Glucose Index
- HBGI	High Blood Glucose Index
- ADRR	Average Daily Risk Range

#### Data Quality ####

Metric	Description	Warning Threshold

- Readings/day	Average daily readings	<24 readings/day
- Wear time	% of possible readings	<70%
- Severe hypo/week	Events <40 mg/dL per week	n/a

### Configuration ###

Key parameters at script top:

- LOW = 70           # Lower bound standard range
- HIGH = 180         # Upper bound standard range
- TIGHT_LOW = 70     # Lower bound tight range
- TIGHT_HIGH = 140   # Upper bound tight range
- BIN_MINUTES = 5    # Time bin size for AGP
- ROC_CLIP = 10      # Rate of change physiological limit

### Limitations & Warnings ###

- Minimum data: AGP typically requires ≥5 days for reliability
- Data gaps: Long gaps (>2 hours) may affect MODD and ADRR calculations
- Sensor accuracy: Assumes CGM-grade data; fingerstick data may have limitations
- MAGE calculation: Uses smoothed data; may differ from manual calculation

### Interpretation Tips ###

- TITR >50% suggests optimal glycemic control
- TBR >4% indicates need for hypoglycemia prevention
- CV >36% suggests unstable glucose, consider variability-reducing therapy
- Nighttime patterns: Shaded area helps identify nocturnal hypoglycemia; however, a sharp "V-shaped" drop with a rapid recovery may indicate sensor compression artifact rather than true hypoglycemia
- ROC spikes indicate rapid changes; correlate with meals/exercise
- GMI < 7.0%: Suggests optimal glycemic control (Note: GMI estimates A1c from CGM data, but may differ from lab A1c).
